          Installation
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Carp is mainly developed on macOS, but it also works fine on Linux.
        Windows is currently not supported - but please do
        <a href="https://gitter.im/carp-lang/Carp">get in touch</a>
        if you want to help out with that!
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that to install the current version of Carp, you’ll have
        to have some familiarity with the command line, and be in the mood to
        tinker a little bit!
      </p>
      <h3>Building the Carp executable from source</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Make sure you have <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Stack</a>
          installed.
        </li>
        <li>Clone this repo to your machine.</li>
        <li>
          Run <code>stack build</code> in the root of the project directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>stack install</code> will install the Carp command line
          tool for easy access on your system.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure that the directory where stack installs executables is
          on your path, for instance with <code>export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH</code>.
          To make this permanent, you’ll have to add this to your `.bashrc`.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Setting the <code>CARP_DIR</code> variable</h3>
      <p>
        The Carp executable must know where to find its core libraries and
        other files. Set the environment variable <code>CARP_DIR</code> so
        that it points to the root of the Carp repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add <code>export CARP_DIR=~/Carp</code> to your
        <code>.bashrc</code> file. The directory should be the one you
        cloned the repository in.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should now be able to start Carp from anywhere using the command
        <code>carp</code>!
