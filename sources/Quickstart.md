After [installing Carp](./install.html), youâ€™ll probably want to play around
with it a bit. Documentation for Carp is currently a little sparse, but we do
have some references to point you to!

### Language Guides

- There is [a user-contributed language overview](https://blog.veitheller.de/Carp.html)
  on the web that will help you get started with the language.
- If you want to know more about the internals of the Carp compiler, there is
  [a blog post](https://blog.veitheller.de/The_Carp_Compiler_%28as_of_2017%29.html)
  on that as well.
- There is [a small tutorial](https://blog.veitheller.de/Carp_and_C_%28as_of_2017%29.html)
  on how to interface Carp and C.

### Project-based Learning

- [This tutorial](https://blog.veitheller.de/Introducing_anima.html) will teach
  you how to generate a little artwork using a drawing framework written in
  Carp.
- A bit more algorithmically interesting, there is [a
  tutorial](https://blog.veitheller.de/Lets_Write_a_Hashmap_in_Carp.html) on
  how to write a Hashmap in Carp!
