After [installing Carp](./install.html), youâ€™ll probably want to play around
with it a bit. Documentation for Carp is currently a little sparse, but we do
have some references to point you to!

### Language Guides

- There is [a language overview](https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp/blob/master/docs/LanguageGuide.md)
  in the docs that will help you get started with the language.
- If you want to know more about the internals of the Carp compiler, there is
  [a document](https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp/blob/master/docs/hacking.md)
  on that as well.
- If you want to learn more about how to write macros, [check out this
  guide!](https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp/blob/master/docs/Macros.md)
